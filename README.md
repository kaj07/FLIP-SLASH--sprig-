A unique puzzle game based on flipping the colours of the screen.

A link to the current code can be found here: https://sprig.hackclub.com/share/vPyZJS4e3j40K7ncqFiP

- Features a loading screen before the main menu
- Will be comprised of several levels
- My first proper project using Javascript!

[currently the first level is finished but has no detection when you have done so]
